						<p class="info">Now knowing our goals for the audience, we were able to make call-to-action (CTA) buttons to help users navigate around depending on their needs. We also created a style tile, which helped layout our design for the future redesign.</p>

                    <header>
                        <h2>Call-To-Action</h2>
                    </header>
                    <div class="image fit grayBorder">
                        <img src="images/cta.jpg" width="600px" alt="" />
                    </div>
                    <p>The two of the call-to-action (CTA) pieces I choose to use were “Donate” and “Safety Exit”. The Donate CTA is pretty self-explanatory, it locates the user to a section where they can donate things such as money, toys, etc. Even if wanted, they can become a sponsor to the non-profit organization. The Safety Exit CTA is used for the user in terms of a user who is needing help. This button is present to help protect the user from further violence, or maybe even if they aren’t ready to commit such a thing yet. They are easily able to click it once, and be relocated to Google, not even being able to go back in your history to the website.</p>
    
                    <p><i>EX: Say it’s a parent to child relationship. The child might be in their room trying to reach out because they want help. If their parent(s) were to ever find out they were on there, they would be in big trouble. If the parent walks in and is curious on what they are doing, they can easily make it seem they were just on Google.</i></p>

                        <h2>Style Tile</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>For my style tile, the adjectives I choose to base my design off of were Accessible, Reliable, Warm, Simple, and Compassionate. Being a very touchy yet complicated topic for some of us to understand, I really wanted to make something that only welcomes people with open arms and be really effective in the sense of its navigation around the website. </p>
    
                    <div class="image fit grayBorder">
                        <img src="images/StyleTile.jpg" alt="" />
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>There original logo was black and really crowded with a border around the girl figure and text, making it hard to see from a distance. So, I used only the girl figure as the logo, and typed the logo right next to it. I think this is the most effective because people could recognize the girl and know who they are. I provided the hotline and teen numbers on the front in case of an emergency scenario where those numbers are needed quick. I lessened the number of tabs in the navigation bar because it was too squished and did fit the simplicity theme I was going for.</p> 
					<p>I kept the fonts in sans-serif so isn’t too overwhelming, and simple for people to read. Organization is important in this scenario instead of design, even though that is also a big portion. When comes to images, as previously mentioned, it is very difficult to find images on this topic, but since this is a non-profit organization, they have artworks to show off, volunteer images, advertisements, etc. Nothing much to show, it’s more about spreading the word.</p>
