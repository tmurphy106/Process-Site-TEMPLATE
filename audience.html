						<h1>Audience & Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">After doing the research and reaching out to my clients, I was then able to separate the users into two groups and be able to plan out the user’s top priorities when using the website.</p>

						<h2>Audience</h2>
					</header>

					<p>There are 2 main objectives when it comes to this specific topic. Those are just those who need help and want to help.</p>
					
					<p<span class="image left"><img src="images/PI03 copy.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is the Need Help category. Now I had it break down to 3 basic categories of age. Children which range from newborn to 12 years-old, Teen which is 13-20 years-old, and Adults which is 21+. Underneath all of those sections, I labeled just a few of parties that may either be places they are affected, or types of people who hurt them. The pink one at the bottom represents themselves, because it can be built off of someone else, and they can move to doing it to themselves.</p>

					<p<span class="image left"><img src="images/PI04.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is the Give Help category. It was first split into 2 categories, direct and indirect. People who can directly and indirectly help. Indirectly was focused on organizations, sponsors, etc. Organizations and sponsors can be along the lines of schools, programs, health businesses (orthodontics, hospitals, psychiatrist, etc.), donation stores, etc. Directly was focused on family, friends, volunteers, advisors, etc.</p>

					<p<span class="image left"><img src="images/PI05.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is little section to talk about the people who are a part of the fight to help stop domestic violence. Th community helps with fundraisers, posters, merch, just being able to spread the word. People who have maybe previously been through a similar scenario. Also, maybe someone who has seen or been near someone going through it. They all do their part in standing strong for multiple people, not even just locally, even around the world.</p>

					<p<span class="image left"><img src="images/PI06.jpg" alt="" /></span>When it comes to skeptics, its more about the person that is a part of the action, doing the abuse to someone else. The person or multiple people could have mental issues, which trigger a number of things. They could not have a good personal life, for example lonely, so they don’t know how to nicely interact with others. People that surround you on a daily could really do anything, you never know, you just have to always be cautious unless something is confirmed.</p>
