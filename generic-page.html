					<p>I began my research by looking over the website in it's individual sections and also as a whole. This entire website is not bad in any means, but with there mission, I believe it has great potential, and I'm glad I get to be apart of that. Each page individual just seems really empty. There is basically just a few sentences on the topic, and it is rare to see a picture of anything, not even event details, etc.</p>
					<p>The Home page just their mission in small text on the right hand side, then the left side has reviews. Which is unusual for a Home page, usually there is a page dedicated to those. There Contacts page is pretty self-explanitory, what their message is and all the forms of connection with them. Their Breaking Silence page is dedicated to a little bit of facts when it comes to abusive/unhealthy relationships. It's very simple and straight to the point. The Footer at the bottom once again has all their contact infomation, but also a littl forum section for ou to sign up for their Email list, to get the latest updates and all.</p>

					<p>The following images below consist of some of the adverising images of flyers i was able to find, most of these are from their facebook page. They are good at posting often to really keep peoples hope up, no matter who is the one viewing it. There are some basic imformation about doomestic violence and what to look for, some cute examples of volunteers experience and time in the company, some event flyers, they cover a majority of information that not only gives basci advice, but really shows what their community is like so if you were ever to participate in any form, you get a feel for it.</p>
